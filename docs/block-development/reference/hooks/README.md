# Hooks

We have several hooks that can be used by extensions, some are new and some are hooks that already exist in WooCommerce core.

- [Filters](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/client/blocks/docs/third-party-developers/extensibility/hooks/filters.md)
- [Actions](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/client/blocks/docs/third-party-developers/extensibility/hooks/actions.md)

We also have a list of hooks that have been migrated from WooCommerce Core, but that have been renamed.
