# WooCommerce Release Monitoring

After the release, the release lead should continue to monitor the following for any bugs directly related to the latest version.  Monitoring should continue for 3 days after a major release and 1 day for a point release.

If there are questions whether a specific issue is critical enough to warrant creating a new Point Release Fix, please start a discussion WooCommerce Slack [#core-development](https://woocommercecommunity.slack.com/archives/C4TNYTR28).

## WordPress.org Forums

Check newly created threads on the [WordPress.org Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/) for any issues that appear to be caused by the latest update.

## WooCommerce GitHub Repository Issues

Watch the [Newest Created Issues](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20sort%3Acreated-desc) and verify that none are critical.
